# Openlol
Free the memes!

## What is Openlol?

Memes have become an important cornerstone of internet culture. Sharing of memes has become a process many people enjoy participating in.
However, this process has become dominated by the platforms on which this process occurs. Reddit, Facebook, 9gag and other such platforms dictate what is and isn't allowed on their platforms.

At first glance, this seems reasonable. Otherwise, people could misuse those platforms to distribute illegal content. However, this isn't the sole reason platforms decide to censor content.
Platforms such as Reddit are well-known to censor and ban users who post memes that oppose their subscribed ideologies. In my opinion, this inhibits the freedom of speech for any internet user.

As such, I decided to create Openlol.

## What are the principles of Openlol?

The principle of Openlol is to be as free as possible.

What this means in practice, is that the rules are designed to allow as much freedom as possible. Each rule was carefully worded and is given an explanation.

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Do not submit content which violates the laws of the territory which hosts Openlol. | This rule exists for legal reasons. In order to sustain, Openlol must adhere to the laws of the territory which hosts Openlol. |
| 2. Do not submit content through automated means. | This rule exists to counter spam. The idea of Openlol is to express (hopefully original) memes, which is not possible if the available content is flooded with automated spam. |

## What is the history of Openlol?

Everything started on 9gag. While today 9gag is considered to be "facebook but with more pictures", there was a time where most content that was posted was original and funny.
As time went on, more and more people wanted to participate and "be seen", but without the means to produce actually interesting content.
As such, they resorted to reposting things from other websites, or unrelated content. Many people posted pictures of their pets, begging "Can my <cat, dog, etc.> be a meme please?". Others just posted pictures of themselves, completely missing the point of what a "meme" is.
The situation became gradually worse, and the "Front" page became littered with unfunny and unrelated content. "Rising" and eventually "Fresh" were the only places left where any kind of originality could be found.

Suddenly, some posts began mentioning a new site. The posts and comments were soon after deleted, but the active users of 9gag would spot the name sooner or later. A new site was born: Hugelol.
It was everything 9gag used to be. Original content, dark humor, a place that felt right at home for so many people. However, the peace would not last as long as many would have hoped.
Money was the problem this time, as advertisers did not want to be associated with "dark humor". This seems strange, as TV shows based on dark and "incorrect" humor have the most sought-after advertisement spots; but I digress.
Users offered solutions, from donations to premium accounts. People debated furiously, and what many refer to as "the schism" happened.

Hugelol was split right in two (I swear I stop with the Tool references now) and born was its new sister-site: Hiddenlol. The idea was simple. Dark humor was supposed to be posted on Hiddenlol, and regular, advertiser-friendly humor was supposed to go on the main site.
Given that Hiddenlol was designed for dark humor, the humor was more akin to "black humor". Anything seemed to be on-topic. People posted whatever they wanted.

While for some the idea of seeing a dead body with a "funny" caption might be repulsive, to others it was just another day on the internet.
Hiddenlol formed its own subculture, with its own internal counterculture, and flourished. Hugelol mostly considered Hiddenlol as it's "ugly little cousin", but the connection was there nonetheless.

However, the peace would not last. Shortly after the New Zealand Shooting, Hiddenlol effectively became dead. Users were not able to post anymore, and an automated system which copied content from Reddit was in place.
Hiddenlols active users tried to find refuge in a private Subreddit, but were soon after deleted from Reddit for allegedly posting "violent content". From personal accounts, I never witnessed any violent content being posted. I believe that Reddit did not want to be associated with Hiddenlols humor and simply denied refuge.

This is where Openlol comes in. The idea is to continue Hiddenlol in spirit, while mending its mistakes from the past.
